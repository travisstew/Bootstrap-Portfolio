                  <p>A full stack web developer who enjoys building clean simple beautiful web designs. I’m originally from South Boston, VA and later moved to Chester, VA for further opportunities.  In 2017 I graduated from John Tyler community college with an Associate of Science degree in computer science.  There I fell in love with coding in Java and developed an appetite for algorithms and how to generate code to solve problems. After graduating I decided to dive into full stack web development by way of self-taught.  The ability to understand how things work and to challenge myself on how to make it more efficient is what keeps me motivated.  furthermore, I decided to embark on a new course in life by starting a full stack web developers coding bootcamp that requires a great amount of dedication and resilience.  I find satisfaction in understanding people on team and utilizing everybody’s strengths to find one common goal.  In my off time from work I enjoy spending it with my daughter, and I plan on teaching her coding as she gets older.  The beauty in developing is the amount of knowledge you gain along the way in struggle to figure out the the one simple bug that you ultimately discovered to be something very simple. </p>
